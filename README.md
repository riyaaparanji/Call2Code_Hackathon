🎓 Club Connect

> From scattered announcements to chaotic recruitments, student clubs are running on broken systems—and it’s costing students the chance to truly connect and grow.
> ClubConnect is your one stop solution to all these problems 
> Built at **Call2Code Hackathon**, fueled by 2 cups of coffee,  and a mini existential crisis.
